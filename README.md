# Eurovision 2022

This is a repo hosting data and analysis from Eurovision 2022. The basic idea is that I suspect loads of people will be wanting to play around with Eurovision data both before and after the Grand Final, and there's no point everyone converting PDFs into CSVs (etc) separately when we could just do it all in one go.

My code's all in R but hopefully the files I produce will be usable regardless of language.
